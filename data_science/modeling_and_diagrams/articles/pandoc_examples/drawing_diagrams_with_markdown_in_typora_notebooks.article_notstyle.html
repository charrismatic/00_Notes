<h1>Draw Diagrams With Markdown</h1>
<p>Typora supports some Markdown extension for diagrams, you could enable this feature from preference panel.</p>
<p>When exporting as HTML, PDF, epub, docx, those rendered diagrams will also be included, but diagrams features are not supported when exporting markdown into other file formats in current version. Besides, you should also notice that diagrams is not supported by standard Markdown, CommonMark or GFM. Therefore, we still recommend you to insert an image of these diagrams instead of write them in Markdown directly.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Sequence</h2>
<p>It is powered by js-sequence, which would turn following code block into rendered diagrams:</p>
<pre><code class='language-sequence' lang='sequence'>Alice-&gt;Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob--&gt;Alice: I am good thanks!
</code></pre>
<p>Please refer here for syntax explanation.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Flowchart</h2>
<p>It is powered by flowchart.js, which would turn following code block into rendered diagrams:</p>
<pre><code class='language-flow' lang='flow'>st=&gt;start: Start
op=&gt;operation: Your Operation
cond=&gt;condition: Yes or No?
e=&gt;end

st-&gt;op-&gt;cond
cond(yes)-&gt;e
cond(no)-&gt;op
</code></pre>

<p>Typora also has integration with mermaid, which supports sequence, flowchart and Gantt.</p>

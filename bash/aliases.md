 ALIASES
        Aliases  allow  a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command.  The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the alias and unalias
        builtin commands (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, that word is replaced by the text of the  alias.
        The characters /, $, `, and = and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement text may contain any valid shell input, including
        shell metacharacters.  The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time.  This  means  that  one  may
        alias  ls to ls -F, for instance, and bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.  If the last character of the alias value is a blank, then the next command word following the alias
        is also checked for alias expansion.

        Aliases are created and listed with the alias command, and removed with the unalias command.

        There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see FUNCTIONS below).

        Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

        The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing.  Bash always reads at least one complete line of input before executing any of the commands on that  line.   Aliases  are
        expanded  when a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is read.  The
        commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias.  This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is
        read,  not  when  the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed.
        To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use alias in compound commands.

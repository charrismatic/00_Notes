ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
       The  shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain circumstances (see the let and declare builtin commands, the (( compound command, and Arithmetic Expansion).  Evaluation is done
       in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error.  The operators and their precedence, associativity, and values are the same  as  in  the  C
       language.  The following list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

       id++ id--
              variable post-increment and post-decrement
       ++id --id
              variable pre-increment and pre-decrement
       - +    unary minus and plus
       ! ~    logical and bitwise negation
       **     exponentiation
       * / %  multiplication, division, remainder
       + -    addition, subtraction
       << >>  left and right bitwise shifts
       <= >= < >
              comparison
       == !=  equality and inequality
       &      bitwise AND
       ^      bitwise exclusive OR
       |      bitwise OR
       &&     logical AND
       ||     logical OR
       expr?expr:expr
              conditional operator
       = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=
              assignment
       expr1 , expr2
              comma

       Shell  variables  are  allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression, shell variables may also be referenced by name without using the
       parameter expansion syntax.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax.  The value of a variable  is  evaluated  as  an
       arithmetic  expression  when  it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the integer attribute using declare -i is assigned a value.  A null value evaluates to 0.  A shell variable need
       not have its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.

       Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers take the form [base#]n, where the optional base is a decimal number between  2
       and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and n is a number in that base.  If base# is omitted, then base 10 is used.  When specifying n, the digits greater than 9 are represented by the lowercase let‐
       ters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.  If base is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

       Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.

DESCRIPTION
       pstree shows running processes as a tree.   The  tree  is  rooted  at
       either  pid  or init if pid is omitted.  If a user name is specified,
       all process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.

       pstree visually merges identical branches by putting them  in  square
       brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count, e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]

       Child threads of a process are found under the parent process and are
       shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]

       If pstree is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt the user at the
       end  of  the  line to press return and will not return until that has
       happened.  This is useful for when pstree is run in a xterminal.

       Certain kernel or mount parameters, such as the  hidepid  option  for
       procfs, will hide information for some processes. In these situations
       pstree will attempt to build the tree without this information, show‐
       ing process names as question marks.



       OPTIONS
              -a     Show command line arguments.  If the command line of a process
                     is swapped out, that process  is  shown  in  parentheses.   -a
                     implicitly disables compaction for processes but not threads.

              -A     Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.

              -c     Disable  compaction  of  identical subtrees.  By default, sub‐
                     trees are compacted whenever possible.

              -G     Use VT100 line drawing characters.

              -h     Highlight the current process and its ancestors.   This  is  a
                     no-op  if the terminal doesn't support highlighting or if nei‐
                     ther the current process nor any of its ancestors are  in  the
                     subtree being shown.

              -H     Like  -h, but highlight the specified process instead.  Unlike
                     with -h, pstree fails when using -H  if  highlighting  is  not
                     available.

              -g     Show PGIDs.  Process Group IDs are shown as decimal numbers in
                     parentheses after each process name.  -g  implicitly  disables
                     compaction.   If  both  PIDs and PGIDs are displayed then PIDs
                     are shown first.

              -l     Display long lines.  By default, lines are truncated to either
                     the  COLUMNS  environment  variable  or the display width.  If
                     neither of these methods work, the default of 132  columns  is
                     used.

              -n     Sort  processes  with  the  same ancestor by PID instead of by
                     name.  (Numeric sort.)

              -N     Show individual trees for each namespace of  the  type  speci‐
                     fied.  The available types are: ipc, mnt, net, pid, user, uts.
                     Regular users don't have  access  to  other  users'  processes
                     information, so the output will be limited.

              -p     Show  PIDs.   PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses
                     after each process name.  -p implicitly disables compaction.

              -s     Show parent processes of the specified process.

              -S     Show namespaces transitions.  Like -N, the output  is  limited
                     when running as a regular user.

              -t     Show full names for threads when available.

              -T     Hide threads and only show processes.

              -u     Show  uid  transitions.  Whenever the uid of a process differs
                     from the uid of its parent, the new uid is shown in  parenthe‐
                     ses after the process name.

              -U     Use  UTF-8  (Unicode)  line  drawing  characters.  Under Linux
                     1.1-54 and above, UTF-8 mode is entered on  the  console  with
                     echo -e ' 33%8' and left with echo -e ' 33%@'

              -V     Display version information.

              -Z     (SELinux)  Show  security context for each process.  This flag
                     will only work if pstree is compiled with SELinux support.

       FILES
              /proc  location of the proc file system

       BUGS
              Some character sets may be incompatible with the VT100 characters.
